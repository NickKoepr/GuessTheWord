# Guess The Word game

A really simple game where you have to guess the correct word.
The game is playable in English and Dutch.

### Play the game
You can play the game at: https://guesstheword.nickkoepr.nl/

### Tech stack
For this project, I have used TypeScript with React. I created this project solely to learn React :)
For the list of possible words, I have used the repositories [english-words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words) for all English words and [opentaal-wordlist](https://github.com/OpenTaal/opentaal-wordlist) for all the Dutch words.
